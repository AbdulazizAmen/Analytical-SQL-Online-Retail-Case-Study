__implement a Monetary model for customers behavior for product purchasing and segment each customer based on the below groups
Champions - Loyal Customers - Potential Loyalists – Recent Customers – Promising - Customers Needing Attention - At Risk - Cant Lose Them – Hibernating – Lost
The customers will be grouped based on 3 main values
• Recency => how recent the last transaction is (Hint: choose a reference date, which is the most recent purchase in the dataset )
• Frequency => how many times the customer has bought from our store
• Monetary => how much each customer has paid for our products __
